// numbers primes

/* The logic behind what weâ€™re about to do is as follows:

Create an array from two until the value and assign a value of true since we are going to assume everything is prime to start.
Take the square root of our desired value which will represent a limit to our looping.
Loop from two until our new square rooted limit.
Check to see if our current index is prime, otherwise ignore it.
Loop through (i * i) + ix until our initial value where x is incremental starting from value one.
Set every index hit to false because it is no longer a prime number. */
